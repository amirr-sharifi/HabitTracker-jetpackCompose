# Habit Tracker üéØ

A modern, advanced Habit Tracker Android application built with the latest technologies and based on Clean Architecture principles.




## Description üìù

This project is not just a simple application but a showcase of a robust implementation of MVI and Clean Architecture in a modern, 100% Jetpack Compose environment. The primary goal is to build a maintainable, testable, and scalable application for managing and tracking users' daily habits with complex and diverse scheduling capabilities.

## Architecture üèõÔ∏è

This project is built upon the principles of **Clean Architecture** and follows the **MVI (Model-View-Intent)** pattern to create clean, modular, and testable code.

`UI (Compose) ‚Üí ViewModel (MVI) ‚Üí Domain ‚Üí Data (Repository)`




* **Presentation Layer:** Contains the `ViewModels`, which act as State Holders and manage the UI logic following the MVI pattern.
* **Domain Layer:** Includes the core business models and UseCases. This layer is completely independent of the Android framework.
* **Data Layer:** Consists of `Repositories` and Data Sources like the Room Database and services. This layer is responsible for managing and providing data.

* **UI:** [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
    * **Material 3:** For the visual design system.
